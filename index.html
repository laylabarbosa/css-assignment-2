            <p id="first">
                One, two, three, four... 
            </p>
            <p>
                I love the way it <span clas="flow">flows</span><br>
                I love the way it <span class="grow">grows</span><br>
                There's something in this sound that takes me <span class="far">far</span><br>
                It's like a special song<br>
                Can move my mood <span class="along">&emsp;along</span><br>
                But I cannot say you'll hear through my guitar
            </p>
            <p>
                She told me add a bassline<br>
                And everything will be alright<br>
                She told me that the groove is mine<br>
                It will take us through the night<br>
                And where I'll <span class="go"> go</span><br>
                Can't explain I'll never know<br>
                But it's beautiful
            </p>
            <p class="chorus">
                You can't take this away from me<br>
                The way I hear the melody<br>
                The waves bring <span class="clarity">clarity</span><br>
                <span class="running"> Running </span> through me<br>
                You can't take this away from me<br>
                The way I hear the melody<br>
                The waves bring <span class="clarity">clarity</span><br>
                Running through me<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I love the way it sings<br>
                All the joy that it brings<br>
                Remember skating down the road towards the park?<br>
                I can never say no<br>
                You with that  <span class="glow">summer glow</span><br>
                The music gives me sun when winter starts<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                She told me add a bassline<br>
                And everything will be alright<br>
                She told me that the beat is mine<br>
                It will rock us through the night<br>
                And where I'll <span class="go"> go</span><br>
                Can't explain I'll never know<br>
                But it's beautiful
            </p>
            <p class="chorus">
                You can't take this away from me (oh)<br>
                The way I hear the melody<br>
                The waves bring <span class="clarity">clarity</span><br>
                <span class="running"> Running </span> through me<br>
                You can't take this away from me (oh)<br>
                The way I hear the melody<br>
                The waves bring <span class="clarity">clarity</span><br>
                Running through me
            </p>
            <p class="chorus">
                You can't take this away from me (oh)<br>
                The way I hear the melody<br>
                The waves bring <span class="clarity">clarity</span><br>
                <span class="running"> Running </span> through me (c'mon y'all)<br>
                You can't take this away from me (oh)<br>
                The way I hear the melody<br>
                The waves bring <span class="clarity">clarity</span><br>
                Running through me (yeah, it's runing through me)<br>
            </p>
            <p class="rap">
                Yo, I wear notes like coats<br>
                Blues like doos, warm from the rhythm, soul that <span class="blues"> glues</span><br>
                That bounce to my bones, that jazz in my spine<br>
                The hop is my home, rap is my grind<br>
                I'm grindin' on the backside of life, we dance<br>
                She threw me a chance, her hands in my pants<br>
                Actually, my pockets holdin' me tight<br>
                Whispering a dream I could hold in the night
            </p>
            <p class="rap">
                Blood tight, a rhythm that's throbbin' my veins<br>
                Wake up and write it on a pad, the pains<br>
                Like church, the organ will invite the tears<br>
                Like birth, I'm cryin', let you know I'm here<br>
                Held by the song that gave me a name<br>
                Dressed by the verse that gave me a claim<br>
                (There's just a bass in the line) safe to inhale<br>
            </p>
            <p class="rap">
                And if you live well<br>
                Belonger years in this state, you will be<br>
                A timeless octave to play for the tree<br>
                That's rooted in every single nerve in me<br>
                The nerve of he who ignores the key<br>
                And use it to open the mind to be free<br>
                Whenever you're hot head ignores you, you are free<br>
                Beneath the clouds, you allowed to see, in clarity
            </p>
            <p class="rap">
                Through harmony, someone harmin' me?<br>
                That won't be done<br>
                I stand protected by the laws of fun<br>
                I am perfected through the rhymes of Run<br>
                Walkin' this way and leave the party stunned<br>
                This music, it launched me<br>
                With no aim, I've landed with some plane<br>
                Where I am, I can't explain or never know<br>
                But it's beautiful so-
            </p>
            <p class="chorus">
                You can't take this away from me<br>
                The way I hear the melody<br>
                The waves bring <span class="clarity">clarity</span><br>
                <span class="running"> Running </span> through me (c'mon y'all)<br>
                You can't take this away from me<br>
                The way I hear the melody<br>
                The waves bring <span class="clarity">clarity</span><br>
                Running through me
            </p>
